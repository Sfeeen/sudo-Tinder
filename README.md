# sudo Tinder ðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒ
A desktop GUI written in python that interacts with the tinder-servers. It provides some of the basis functionality (swiping, checking pictures) but more importantly it provides some extra features:

* Load multiple potential swipes at once and choose who you swipe and who you do not want to swipe (or swipe later).
* Change your location, fill in the longitude and latitude of were you want to be and the server will think that you are on that location.
* See some people who like you (tinder provides some blurred pictures of people who like you and you could see the pictures if you buy a premium account: those pictures are shown without a blur).

### Note
* This project is not fully finished, errors might occur! feel free to improve the GUI / logic
* If you fetch a lot of swipes, like constantly, than you might get temporarly blocked, there is no check for this in the app yet.

### Usage
run: `python3 app.py` 

windows users can use the generated 'app.exe'
